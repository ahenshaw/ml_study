\section*{Guaranteed questions}
\begin{QandA}
    \item What is machine learning (ML)? 
    \begin{answered} 
        A set of methods that can automatically detect patterns in
        data, and then use the uncovered patterns to predict future
        data, or to perform other kinds of decision making under
        uncertainty (such as planning how to collect more data!)

    \begin{answered}
        \begin{description}

    for $k = 1$ to $K$
        $\mu_k$  := average (mean) of points assigned to cluster $k$
}
        \end{lstlisting}
    \end{answered}

    \item How does the k-means algorithm work?
    \begin{answered}
        The way k-means algorithm works is as follows:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Specify number of clusters K.
            \item Initialize centroids by first shuffling the dataset and then randomly selecting K data points for the centroids without replacement.
            \item Keep iterating until there is no change to the centroids (i.e., assignment of data points to clusters isnâ€™t changing).
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item Compute the sum of the squared distance between data points and all centroids.
                \item Assign each data point to the closest cluster (centroid).
                \item Compute the centroids for the clusters by taking the average of the all data points that belong to each cluster.
            \end{enumerate}
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{answered}

    \item List advantages and disadvantages of k-means.
    \begin{answered}
        \textbf{Advantages} 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item  Easy to implement
            \item With a large number of variables, K-Means may be computationally faster than (than what??)
            \item k-Means may produce tighter clusters than hierarchical clustering
            \item An instance can change cluster (move to another cluster) when the centroids are recomputed. 
        \end{itemize}   
        
        \textbf{Disadvantages}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Difficult to predict the number of clusters (K-Value)
            \item Initial seeds have a strong impact on the final results
            \item The order of the data has an impact on the final results
            \item Sensitive to scale: rescaling your datasets (normalization or standardization) will completely change results. While this itself is not bad, not realizing that you have to spend extra time on to scaling your data might be bad. 
        \end{itemize}   
    \end{answered}

\section*{L16 Hierarchical Clustering \textemdash{} Thu Mar 5}
\begin{QandA}
    \item What is cluster analysis? 
    \begin{answered}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Cluster: A collection of data objects
            \begin{itemize}
                \item similar (or related) to one another within the same group
                \item dissimilar (or unrelated) to the objects in other groups
            \end{itemize}
            \item Cluster analysis (or clustering, data segmentation, \ldots)
            \begin{itemize} 
                \item Finding similarities between data according to the characteristics found in the
                      data and grouping similar data objects into clusters
            \end{itemize}
            \item Unsupervised learning: no predefined classes 
                  (i.e., learning by observations vs. learning by examples: supervised)
        \end{itemize}
    \end{answered}

    \begin{answered}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item As a stand-alone tool to get insight into data distribution.
            \item As a preprocessing step for other algorithms.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{answered}

    \item List, then define the two approaches of hierarchical clustering.
    \begin{answered}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Agglomerative: a bottom-up strategy
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Initially each data object is in its own (atomic) cluster.
                \item Then merge these atomic clusters into larger and larger clusters.
            \end{itemize}
            \item Divisive: a top-down strategy
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Initially, all objects are in one single cluster.
                \item Then the cluster is subdivided into smaller and smaller clusters.
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
    \end{answered}

    \item List all steps of the hierarchical clustering of agglomerative (bottom-up) approach.
    \begin{answered}
        \begin{description}
            \item[Step 1:] Make each data point a single-point cluster $\rightarrow$ That forms $N$ clusters
            \item[Step 2:] Take the two closest data points and make them one cluster $\rightarrow$ That forms $N - 1$ clusters 
            \item[Step 3:] Take \textbf{the two closest clusters} and make them one cluster $\rightarrow$ That forms $N - 2$ clusters
            \item[Step 4:] Repeat Step 3 until there is only one cluster

        \end{description}
    \end{answered}

    \item Define the dendrograms, then illustrate how do dendrograms work with a diagram.
    \begin{answered}
        A dendrogram is a diagram that shows the hierarchical relationship 
        between objects.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item A binary tree that shows how clusters are merged/split hierarchically 
            \item Each node on the tree is a cluster; each leaf node is a singleton cluster
            \begin{figure}[h!]
                \centering
                \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{dendogram.png}
                \caption{Dendogram}
                \label{fig:dendogram}
            \end{figure}

            A clustering of the data objects is obtained by cutting the dendrogram
            at the desired level, then each connected component forms a cluster
        \end{itemize}
    \end{answered}

    \item List, then define all possible methods of merging the clusters that depend on the distance measures.
    \begin{answered}
        \begin{description}
            \item[Single-link] The distance between two clusters is represented by 
                               the distance of the \textcolor{Maroon}{\textbf{closest pair of data objects}} 
                               belonging to different clusters.
            \item[Complete-link] The distance between two clusters is represented by 
                                 the distance of the \textcolor{Maroon}{\textbf{farthest pair of data objects}} 
                                 belonging to different clusters.
            \item[Average-link] The distance between two clusters is represented by 
                                the average distance of \textcolor{Maroon}{\textbf{all pairs of data objects}} 
                                belonging to different clusters.
            \item[Centroid distance] The distance between two clusters is represented by 
                                     \textcolor{Maroon}{\textbf{the means of the clusters}}.

    \end{answered}

    \item What are the advantages and disadvantages of hierarchical clustering?
    \begin{answered}
        \textbf{Advantages} 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Hierarchical clustering outputs a hierarchy, i.e., a 
                structure that is more informative than the unstructured 
                set of flat clusters returned by k-means. Therefore, it is 
                easier to decide on the number of clusters by looking at the dendrograms 
            \item Easy to implement 
        \end{itemize}
        \textbf{Disadvantages}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item It is not possible to undo the previous step: once the 
                instances have been assigned to a cluster, they can no 
                longer be moved around.
            \item Time complexity: not suitable for large datasets 
            \item Initial seeds have a strong impact on the final results
            \item The order of the data has an impact on the final results
            \item Very sensitive to outliers
